# FRESH-CONNECT
Fresh Connect (also referred to as SupplyNest) is a web-based platform designed to connect street food vendors with raw material suppliers. The goal is to simplify raw material sourcing by providing a centralized system for supplier discovery, order placement, and basic user management.

This project focuses on solving real-world problems faced by Indian street food vendors such as lack of transparency, time-consuming sourcing, and dependency on middlemen.
